Hi! I am a PhD Candidate at Stanford University who combines insights and methods from psychology, political science and computer science to develop and evaluate evidence-based interventions to promote the social good.

I am particularly passionate about preventing the spread of misinformation, promoting wellbeing and mental health, and addressing ethical challenges related to new technologies. 

My current research includes a project measuring the reach of influence campaigns on Facebook and Instagram during the 2020 US elections (part of the [Facebook and Instagram Election Study](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2023/july/2020-election-studies-reveals-power-of-facebook--instagram-algor.html)), designing and evaluating an online game to combat vaccine misinformation, and a large-scale evaluation of misinformation interventions on Facebook. I have written about [how partisanship affects content moderation preferences](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adg6799) and about the ethics and [privacy implications of new technologies](https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819200-9.00015-6).
 
I gained work experience as a UX Research Intern at Google, as a Research Associate at the Center for Advanced Hindsight at Duke University, and as an Intern at the EU Delegation to the UN in New York. I holds a Masterâ€™s in Public Policy from Science Po Paris and a B.Sc. in Economics from the University of Mannheim.

As Vice President of the [Stanford German Student Association](https://sgsa.stanford.edu/), she is involved in building transatlantic bridges and co-organized the [Transatlantic Summit 2022](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/events/transatlantic-summit-2022-sovereignty-vs-cooperation-digital-era-silicon-conference), an international conference on geopolitics and tech.
