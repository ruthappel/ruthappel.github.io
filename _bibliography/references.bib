abstract = {Social media companies have come under increasing pressure to remove misinformation from their platforms, but partisan disagreements over what should be removed have stymied efforts to deal with misinformation in the United States. Current explanations for these disagreements center on the “fact gap”—differences in perceptions about what is misinformation. We argue that partisan differences could also be due to “party promotion”—a desire to leave misinformation online that promotes one's own party—or a “preference gap”—differences in internalized preferences about whether misinformation should be removed. Through an experiment where respondents are shown false headlines aligned with their own or the opposing party, we find some evidence of party promotion among Democrats and strong evidence of a preference gap between Democrats and Republicans. Even when Republicans agree that content is false, they are half as likely as Democrats to say that the content should be removed and more than twice as likely to consider removal as censorship.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the new ethical challenges introduced by the age of Big Data. Although there are many other ethical challenges related to technology and data (e.g., addiction, inequality), it reviews the topic of privacy as one of the major challenges associated with Big Data. The chapter introduces the concept of privacy, briefly discussing its history, universality, and core assumptions that lie at the heart of privacy protections. It then moves on to the questions of how Big Data threatens our privacy in unprecedented ways and challenges current approaches to privacy protection. Next, the chapter discusses how placing the burden of privacy protection on users alone is misguided and provide a number of potential systemic solutions related to regulation, collaboration, design principles, and technological tools. It concludes with concrete practical guidelines for researchers and practitioners of how to design studies, products, and services that protect individuals' privacy.},

abstract = {Advances in the collection, storage, and processing of large amounts of user data have given rise to psychological targeting, which we define as the process of extracting individuals’ psychological characteristics from their digital footprints in order to target them with psychologically-informed interventions at scale. In this chapter, we introduce a two-stage framework of psychological targeting consisting of (1) psychological profiling and (2) psychologically-informed interventions. We summarize the most important research findings in relation to the two stages and discuss important methodological opportunities and pitfalls. To help researchers make the most of the opportunities, we also provide practical advice on how to deal with some of the potential pitfalls. Finally, we highlight ethical opportunities and challenges and offer some suggestions for addressing these challenges. If done right, psychological targeting has the potential to advance our scientific understanding of human nature and to enhance the well-being of individuals and society at large.},

abstract = {Psychological targeting describes the practice of extracting people's psychological profiles from their digital footprints (e.g., their Facebook Likes, Tweets or credit card records) in order to influence their attitudes, emotions or behaviors through psychologically-informed interventions at scale. We discuss how the increasingly blurred lines between public and private information, and the continuation of the outdated practices of notice and consent, challenge traditional conceptualizations of privacy in the context of psychological targeting. Drawing on the theory of contextual integrity, we argue that it is time to rethink privacy and move beyond the questions of who collects what data to how the data are being used. Finally, we suggest that regulations of psychological targeting should be accompanied by a mindset that fosters (1) privacy by design to make it easy for individuals to act in line with their privacy goals, as well as (2) disclosure by choice in which individuals can freely decide whether and when they might be willing to forsake their privacy for better service.},
